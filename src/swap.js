            A JavaScript build toolchain typically consists of:

            A package manager, such as Yarn or npm. It lets you take advantage of a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, and easily install or update them.
            A bundler, such as webpack or Parcel. It lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time.
            A compiler such as Babel. It lets you write modern JavaScript code that still works in older browsers.

            </p>
        </>
      );
}

export default Swap;
